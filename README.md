# Linear_Model_Project_Auto-s_MPG
 
The task is to build a model for the response highway_mpg, with all the other variables as potential covariates, and to
draw any appropriate conclusions regarding the associations of highway_mpg with the other variables (e.g. which effects
are positive or negative, which covariates interact with each other, etc).
